# Dots

A demo of using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) with Elixir's [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org)

## To run you will need
* Elixir, [installation](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html), used version 1.0.4 for the talk.
* Elm, [installation](http://elm-lang.org/install), used version 0.15 for the talk.
* nodejs

Then, in your cloned copy of this repo:
```
mix deps.get
npm install
mix phoenix.server
```
Open app at `localhost:4000`

## Step'ing

The repo has some branches I used to advance the talk.
Not all branches are in working condition, so they may require coding or enabling of code to work.

Here is a brief overview. Each branch is called stepX, where X is:

1. after running mix phoenix.new
2. added support for live compile-reload of Elm modules
3. add routes and pages to support the final app
4. add empty Elm modules to support the app
5. the Elm code for Board and Pad (v1)
6. set up socket and channels
7. add input config for Pad, as reply on channel.join
8. try to manage the flooding of messages; use :observer.start()

# TODO's

1. Investigate bottleneck leading to build up of messages in one of channel processes' mailbox.

## Notes
This demo was put together for the [Copenhagen Elixir June 2015 meetup](http://github.com/cphex/cphex/issues/20)

The few "slides" I had can be found [here](https://github.com/madsflensted/presentations/tree/master/cphex_phoenix_and_elm)
